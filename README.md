# LLM-Powered-Hostel-Management-System
A full-stack hostel management platform with admin and student portals, built from scratch using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. This system integrates a local LLM (LLaMA3 via Ollama) using LangChain for admin-side intelligent querying, creating a hybrid of traditional web management and AI-powered assistance.
